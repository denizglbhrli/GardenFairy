 In simplest terms, data received by our sensors are sent to a cloud service. Then, the data is compared to ideal conditions for the plant specified. If ideal conditions are not met, automatic fertilization, watering, and light systems are triggered. Processed data is also broadcasted to an online dashboard and mobile app for the user.
